A **'Vote of Credit'**, on the other hand, is an extraordinary measure for unforeseen emergencies.It is used when, due to a natural disaster, external aggression, or internal disturbances, it is impractical or inexpedient to specify the details of the required expenditure as is normally done in a budget[cite: 1146]. The government lays a Bill before the House of Representatives with only a general statement of expenditures to get a lump-sum grant.

This is an example of cooperative federalism. Under **Article 232(7)**, the process is **interventionist and corrective**; the Federal Parliament can make laws on State matters only during the imposition of *Federal rule* in a State, which happens after that State's government is suspended or dissolved for acting against national sovereignty or integrity.This law applies to the specific State under federal rule and is a tool for the center to manage a state-level crisis [cite: 1667-1668]."

      "answer": "Both articles allow the Federal Parliament to legislate on matters in the State list, but the conceptual basis is entirely different. Under **Article 231(3)**, the process is **cooperative and voluntary**; the Federal Parliament can make laws on a State matter only if two or more States *request* it to do so, and the resulting law applies only to those specific states [cite: 1657-1658]. This is an example of cooperative federalism. Under **Article 232(7)**, the process is **interventionist and corrective**; the Federal Parliament can make laws on State matters only during the imposition of *Federal rule* in a State, which happens after that State's government is suspended or dissolved for acting against national sovereignty or integrity.This law applies to the specific State under federal rule and is a tool for the center to manage a state-level crisis [cite: 1667-1668]."
